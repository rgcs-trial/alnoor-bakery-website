## Overview

Initialize the AL-NOOR BAKERY HALAL website foundation with Astro framework and TypeScript strict mode configuration. This establishes the core project structure, development environment, and basic architecture needed for the halal bakery restaurant website.

## User Stories

### Developer Project Setup

As a developer, I want to initialize the Astro project with TypeScript, so that I can start building the AL-NOOR BAKERY website with type safety and modern web development practices.

The developer needs to create a new Astro project from scratch with TypeScript strict mode, establish the recommended directory structure for restaurant websites, and configure the development environment for Arabic/English content support and mobile-first design.

### Development Environment Configuration

As a developer, I want a properly configured development environment, so that I can efficiently develop with VS Code extensions, type checking, and proper project structure.

The development environment should include VS Code workspace settings, essential extensions for Astro development, and scripts for development workflow including type checking and linting preparation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Astro Project Creation** - Initialize minimal Astro project with TypeScript strict mode configuration
2. **Directory Structure** - Create organized folder structure following CLAUDE.md specifications
3. **Basic Configuration** - Set up astro.config.mjs, tsconfig.json, and package.json scripts
4. **Development Environment** - Configure VS Code settings and extension recommendations
5. **Foundation Layout** - Create base Layout.astro component with proper head structure for i18n and mobile support

## Out of Scope

- Tailwind CSS installation and configuration
- Supabase integration and setup
- Stripe payment integration
- Testing framework setup (Vitest/Playwright)
- Deployment configuration
- Content collections schema definition

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working Astro project with TypeScript that passes `pnpm astro check` without errors
2. Organized project directory structure with all recommended folders created
3. Basic Layout.astro component that properly supports Arabic/English content and mobile viewport
