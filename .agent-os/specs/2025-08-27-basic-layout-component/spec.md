## Overview

Create a foundational layout component system for the halal bakery website using Astro framework with mobile-first responsive design, clean English typography, and optimized SEO structure. This component will serve as the foundation for all pages, providing consistent navigation, branding, and user experience across the entire website.

## User Stories

1. **As a bakery customer**, I want to easily navigate between different sections of the website (products, about, contact) through a consistent header navigation that works perfectly on both mobile and desktop devices.

2. **As a mobile user**, I want to access the website seamlessly on my smartphone with fast loading, touch-friendly navigation, and readable typography optimized for small screens.

3. **As a search engine crawler**, I want to access properly structured HTML with semantic elements, meta tags, and schema markup to effectively index the bakery's content and improve search rankings.

## Spec Scope

1. **Base Layout Structure** - Create Astro Layout.astro component with semantic HTML5 structure (header, nav, main, aside, footer) and proper document head configuration
2. **Responsive Header Navigation** - Implement mobile-first navigation with hamburger menu, logo placement, and smooth transitions between mobile/desktop views
3. **Clean Typography System** - Configure Tailwind CSS with modern English font families, proper line heights, and readable text hierarchy
4. **SEO Foundation** - Integrate meta tags, Open Graph properties, structured data markup, and canonical URL management within the layout
5. **Footer Component** - Design comprehensive footer with business information, social links, operating hours, and halal certification display

## Out of Scope

- Advanced animations and micro-interactions (reserved for future enhancement specs)
- Shopping cart functionality and user authentication components
- Blog post layouts and content management system integration
- Third-party service integrations (payments, analytics, live chat)
- Multi-language content management and translation workflows

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Layout System** - Working Layout.astro component that renders correctly in browser with proper responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
2. **Typography Validation** - English text displays with correct fonts, spacing, and readable hierarchy when viewed in browser
3. **SEO Compliance** - HTML structure passes validation and includes all required meta tags, schema markup, and accessibility attributes for search engine optimization
