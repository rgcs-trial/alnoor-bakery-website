## Overview

Set up the core development environment foundation for AL-NOOR BAKERY's Astro website by installing and configuring essential packages including Astro 4.0+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase client, and development tools.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to have all necessary packages installed and configured so that I can begin developing the bakery website with modern web technologies and proper development workflows.

**As a project maintainer**, I want consistent package versions and development scripts configured so that all team members can run the project reliably in their local environments.

**As a deployment engineer**, I want environment variable templates and build configurations set up so that the application can be properly configured for different deployment environments.

## Spec Scope

1. Install Astro 4.0+ framework with TypeScript support
2. Configure Tailwind CSS for styling with proper purging and optimization
3. Install and configure Supabase JavaScript client for database connectivity
4. Set up development tools including ESLint, Prettier, and dev scripts
5. Create environment variable templates for local and production configurations

## Out of Scope

- Deep integration implementation between services
- Complete project structure creation (components, layouts, pages)
- Advanced testing setup and test suites
- Deployment pipeline configuration
- Custom Tailwind theme implementation
- Database schema design or migrations
- Authentication flow implementation
- Advanced Astro configurations (SSR, integrations beyond basic setup)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Development Environment**: All packages installed with working dev server that can be started via `pnpm dev`
2. **Configuration Files**: Properly configured TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, and Prettier files that work together without conflicts
3. **Environment Templates**: `.env.example` file with documented environment variables needed for Supabase and other services
