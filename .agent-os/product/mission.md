## The Problem

### Limited Digital Presence for Halal Bakeries

Many halal bakeries lack professional, mobile-friendly websites that effectively showcase their offerings. Customers struggle to find detailed menu information, pricing, and business details online, leading to missed opportunities for both customers and businesses.

**Our Solution:** A modern, responsive website that beautifully presents AL-NOOR BAKERY's menu with detailed item information and clear pathways to ordering.

### Poor Menu Discovery Experience

Traditional bakery websites often have outdated designs with poor mobile experience and limited item details. Customers can't easily browse menu categories or learn about specific items before visiting or ordering.

**Our Solution:** An intuitive menu browsing experience with item detail popups, high-quality images, and organized categories that work seamlessly across all devices.

### Disconnected Ordering Experience

Many restaurant websites either lack ordering functionality or have poorly integrated ordering systems that confuse customers about how to actually purchase items.

**Our Solution:** Clear "Order Now" call-to-actions that seamlessly redirect to the dedicated ordering application, maintaining a smooth customer journey.

### Integrated Ordering Journey

Unlike websites with broken or confusing ordering processes, AL-NOOR BAKERY provides clear, consistent pathways to the ordering application. This results in higher conversion rates and reduced customer drop-off during the ordering process.
